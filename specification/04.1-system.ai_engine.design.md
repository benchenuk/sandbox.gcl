- Implement a command line app based on LangChain framework using Java.
- The app is designed for learning language, using generative LLM model.
- The app takes key words or simple phrases in the specified language (default English) and desired target language (e.g. Japanese), in return the app takes advantage of LLM model and responds with the following:
    1) direct translation of the key words or simple phrases into the target language
    2) related vocabulary or phrases to the original user query in both languages
    3) 1 or 2 more comprehensive sentences in practical usage related to the original user query in both languages
    4) lastly, more advanced and longer content (e.g. conversation or multiple paragraphs) related but more extensive to the original user query.
- If LangChain supports Ollama, then integrate with Ollama. Otherwise, integrate using OpenAI.
- The response must be in JSON format.
